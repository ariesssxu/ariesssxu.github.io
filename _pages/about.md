*Manjie Xu* is a MSc.22 at School of Computer Science & Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology and an incoming Ph.D student at Peking University. I'm in the [Cognitive Reasoning Lab (CoRe Lab) , Peking University](https://pku.ai/) and [Perception, Interaction, Embodiment Lab (Pie Lab), BIT](https://pie-lab.cn/). I also work in [RedNote](https://xiaohongshu.com/). I'm now under the direction of Prof. [Wei Liang](https://liangwei-bit.github.io/web/) and Prof. [Yixin Zhu](https://yzhu.io/).  

I used to major Brain Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Kuang Yaming Honor School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). He used to be in the [National Key Laboratory of General Artificial Intelligence, BIGAI](https://bigai.ai/) and [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/about/). 

## Interest
My research focuses on developing intelligent agents that are not only adaptive to their environments but also synergistic in their interactions with humans. Drawing inspiration from both theoretical frameworks and empirical studies—particularly those revealing the advanced cognitive abilities of even very young children—I aim to integrate human-like learning and reasoning processes with modern machine learning techniques. My current pursuits are twofold:
*1)* designing algorithms and agents with human-level reasoning capabilities to benefit downstream tasks, and
*2)* developing systems that can proactively engage with and learn from online environments.


Specifically, in light of the significant advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs), I'm also interested in customing LLMs for domain-specific tasks like reasoning and generation and make llm-guided agents that can interact with the environment.
