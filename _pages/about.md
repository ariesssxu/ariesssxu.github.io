# Projects
## Communication Mechanism
We focus on human's communication mechanism, especially nonverbal communication. We are trying to build a simulator to mimic human's communication infrastructure which supports bidirectional reasoning at different level. More details to be released after acceptance. 
## Interactive Abstract Reasoning: Scientific Thinking
An environment as a testbed for agents' scientific thinking ability. We focus on Visual Reasoning and Causal Discovery. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09203)
## Concept Complexity at Pixel Level
More details to be released after acceptance. 
## Video Enhancement
A video enhancement project which enables on-line noise removal. # Demos to be add
## On the Personality of Pre-trained Language Models
Originated as a philosophical quest, personality discerns how individuals differ from each other in terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Towards building social machines that work with humans on a daily basis, we are motivated to ask: Do existing pre-trained language models possess personality, akin to their human counterpart?
