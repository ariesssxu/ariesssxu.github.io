# Interest
My research is focused on making intelligent agents that are not only **adaptive** to their environment but also **synergistic** in their interactions with humans. Drawing inspiration from both theoretical frameworks and empirical studies, which reveal the advanced cognitive capabilities of even very young toddlers, my research combines human-like learning and reasoning processes together with modern machine learning techniques. My current pursuits are mainly twofold: *1)* designing agents capable of inferring human intentions and preferences from vision to enhance human-robot cooperation, and *2)* developing systems that proactively engage with and learn from their surroundings.
# News

## Communication Mechanism
We focus on human's communication mechanism, especially nonverbal communication. We are trying to build a simulator to mimic human's communication infrastructure which supports bidirectional reasoning at different level. More details to be released after acceptance. 
## Interactive Abstract Reasoning
Theoretical ideas and empirical research have shown us a seemingly surprising result: children, even very young toddlers, demonstrate learning and thinking in a strikingly similar manner to scientific reasoning in formal research. Encountering a novel phenomenon, children make hypotheses against data, conduct causal inference from observation, test their theory via experimentation, and correct the proposition if inconsistency arises. Towards building machines that can learn and think like people, we want to ask: whether the intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a scientific thinking process, and if any, at what level?

## Concept Learning
We consider concept generalization at a large scale in the diverse and natural visual spectrum. Established computational modes (i.e., rule-based or similarity-based) are primarily studied isolated and focus on confined and abstract problem spaces. In this work, we study these two modes when the problem space scales up, and the complexity of concepts becomes diverse. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11033)
## Personalized Pre-trained Language Models
Originated as a philosophical quest, personality discerns how individuals differ from each other in terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Towards building social machines that work with humans on a daily basis, we are motivated to ask: Do existing pre-trained language models possess personality, akin to their human counterpart?
