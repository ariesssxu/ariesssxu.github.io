 *Manjie Xu* is a MSc.22 at School of Computer Science & Technology, [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/). He is in the [CoRe Lab, Peking University](https://pku.ai/) and [Mcis Lab 105, Beijing Institute of Technology](https://liangwei-bit.github.io/web/people-liangwei.html). He is also working in [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://bigai.ai/). He is now under the direction of Prof. [Wei Liang](https://liangwei-bit.github.io/web/) and Prof. [Yixin Zhu](https://yzhu.io/).  
He used to major Brain Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Kuang Yaming Honor School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/).  
He is a reviewer of ECCV22 and NeurIPS 2022.

# Research
## Communication Mechanism
We focus on human's communication mechanism, especially nonverbal communication. We are trying to build a simulator to mimic human's communication infrastructure which supports bidirectional reasoning at different level. More details to be released after acceptance. 
## Interactive Abstract Reasoning: Scientific Thinking
Theoretical ideas and empirical research have shown us a seemingly surprising result: children, even very young toddlers, demonstrate learning and thinking in a strikingly similar manner to scientific reasoning in formal research. Encountering a novel phenomenon, children make hypotheses against data, conduct causal inference from observation, test their theory via experimentation, and correct the proposition if inconsistency arises. Rounds of such processes continue until the underlying mechanism is found. Towards building machines that can learn and think like people, one natural question for us to ask is: whether the intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a scientific thinking process, and if any, at what level?

## Concept Complexity at Pixel Level
We consider concept generalization at a large scale in the diverse and natural visual spectrum. Established computational modes (i.e., rule-based or similarity-based) are primarily studied isolated and focus on confined and abstract problem spaces. In this work, we study these two modes when the problem space scales up, and the complexity of concepts becomes diverse. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11033)
## Video Enhancement
A video enhancement project which enables on-line noise removal. # Demos to be add
## On the Personality of Pre-trained Language Models
Originated as a philosophical quest, personality discerns how individuals differ from each other in terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Towards building social machines that work with humans on a daily basis, we are motivated to ask: Do existing pre-trained language models possess personality, akin to their human counterpart?
