# Interest
My research is focused on making intelligent agents that are not only **adaptive** to their environment but also **synergistic** in their interactions with humans. Drawing inspiration from both theoretical frameworks and empirical studies, which reveal the advanced cognitive capabilities of even very young toddlers, my research combines human-like learning and reasoning processes together with modern machine learning techniques. My current pursuits are mainly twofold: *1)* designing agents capable of inferring human intentions and preferences from vision to enhance human-robot cooperation, and *2)* developing systems that proactively engage with and learn from their surroundings.  
Specifically, in light of the significant advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs), I'm also interested in customing LLMs for domain-specific tasks like code generation or causal reasoning and make llm-guided agents that can interact with the world.
